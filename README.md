# Loan Calculator


**This loan calculator is able to work with different types of payment and accept command-line arguments** 

There are two kinds of loan: those with annuity payment and those with differentiated payment. Annuity type of payment consists in paying a fixed sum of money at specified intervals, for example, each month or each year. The annuity payment amount is precisely this fixed sum of money that you need to pay at regular intervals.
Differentiated type is the type of repayment where the loan principal is reduced by a constant amount each month. The rest of the monthly payment goes toward interest repayment and it is gradually reduced over the term of the loan. This means that the payment is different each month.

To calculate differentiated payments, the user can run the program specifying interest, number of monthly payments, and loan principal.

To calculate principal, number of monthly payments, and monthly payment amount for annuity payment, the user specifies all the known parameters, and one parameter will be unknown. This is the value the user wants to calculate.

The principal is the original amount of money you borrow. The interest is a charge for borrowing that money, usually calculated as a percentage of the principal amount.

The Loan Calculator takes several parameters that user specifies with command-line arguments, calculates the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment and overpayment), and outputs them to the user.
